pip install Django==4.1.2
for mac:-> pip3 install django==4.1.2

make a directory Django project—> o1 project

terminal:-> go to the particular directory

django-admin startproject helloworld—> it gives you all the boilerplate 
now you will get sqlite file

cd hello	world
python3 manage.py runserver


Understanding the file structure:->
init file:-> we don’t touch this file

settings.py:- what kind of django settings you are using, never show the secret key to anyone. it is dangerous. Since we are not deploying this project to serbver so it’s fine.
BASE_DIR = Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent:-> you have to set when you are hosting it to live server.
INSTALLED_APPS = In django everything is in the form of app.
MIDDLEWARE =sometimes you may require
TEMPLATES :- usually we don’t touch that only if we change the directory we need to mention it here DIRS": [].
DATABASES:- compatible with sqlite3, mysql, posgres, firebase etc
AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS = we don’t touch them very often
STATIC_URL:- how you can add yor static file like html, css, js or bootstrap fileetc


urls.py:- The most important file. This is the first file which will get interacted once you make a request.
Here we mention where the user needs to go.

wsgi.py(web service gateway interface file):- we don’t touch it usually


db.sqlite3:- not redable in our editor. we have appln for that

manage.py:- how to manage and import our database here.


Till now we havn’t seen 
where are our models where we will be writing quaries to interacting with our sqlite database. 
where is our view file where we write what happen when you click on sth.
Honestly these files are not even present here.
for that we need to create an app. we have just created a project till now.


Our very first Django app:-> we are going to create an app called hola
ls
python3 manage.py startapp hola:-> hola app got created
helloworld is our base app and inside that we have created an app named hola.

Explore hola app
init:- we don’t touch this one.
admin.py:-> configuration file for buikt in Django admin app.
apps.py:->  configuration file for app itself. we will be defining lot of classes and all here.
models.py:-> here we define database models, writing configuration for database. Django automatically translates it to tables.
test.py:- mainly for unit testing
views.py:- handles all the request and response logic for your web application. when user hits a button what is supposed to happen whether to get data from database or serve a webpage?

Configuring new app
step1:- settings.py:-> INSTALLED_APPS-> ‘hola’,

step 2:- hola:-> views.py:- 
from django.shortcuts import render
from django.http import HttpResponse
# Create your views here.
def homePageView(request):
    return HttpResponse("Hola means Hello in Spanish")


step 3:- make a file in hola called urls.py
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path("", views.homePageView, name='home'),
    ]

step 4:- helloworld/urls
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path("admin/", admin.site.urls),
    path(" ", include('hola.urls'))
]

now run the server:- python3 manage.py runserver
hit the url in browser i.e 127.0.0.1:8000
